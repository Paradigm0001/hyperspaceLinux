# Hyperspace Linux Walkthough
### The Walkthough installer for FTL Hyperspace on Linux.

This shell script and its bundled resources will walk the user (you) though the installation of FTL Hyperspace on Linux

Do not download from the source, refer to releases page for download. The repo is constantly being git --force and modified, making its consistancy questionable.

#### This walkthough assumes you know how to use the slipstream mod manager, you download it from here: https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17102

If there are any issues/suggestions, please make an issue ticket or DM me on discord at `Paradigm#0001`
