# Hyperspace Linux Walkthough
### `Currently broken!`
Hyperspace requires a specific version of FTL to function however unfortunately the ability\
to download specific depots from steam as been borked, leaving hyperspace stranded.

### The Walkthough installer for FTL Hyperspace on Linux.

#### This walkthough assumes you know how to use the slipstream mod manager, you download it from [here](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17102)

This shell script and its bundled resources will walk the user (you) though the installation of FTL Hyperspace on Linux

Do not download from the source, refer to the [releases page for download](https://github.com/Paradigm0001/hyperspaceLinux/releases).\
The repo's source is constantly being force pushed and modified, making its consistancy questionable.

If there are any issues/suggestions, please make an issue ticket or DM me on discord at `Paradigm#0001`
