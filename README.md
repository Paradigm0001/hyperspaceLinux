# Hyperspace Linux Walkthough
### The Walkthough installer for FTL Hyperspace on Linux.

This shell script and its bundled resources will walk the user though the installation of FTL Hyperspace on Linux

This walkthough assumes you know how to use the slipstream mod manager.
The Slipstream mod manager is *NOT* bundled with the setup, you download it from here: https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17102
