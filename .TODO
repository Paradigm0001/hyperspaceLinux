## Dichotomize Steam and GOG versions
As it stands, both GOG and Steam versions can be "Hyperspaced". However this script only operates with Steam.

To get the GOG version to work, you have to download the windows installer from GOG and run it with wine (it works perfectly fine) and I could automate
and walk a user though that easily.

A backburner idea (which might come to life faster given demand) is to dichotomize the script into two (or a master that presents the option for one or the other).
One version being for steam, other being GOG.

The only thing holding me back is time and motovation, both easily changed however.

## Reduce unnecessary dependencies
The script doesnt REALLY need to have xclip as a dependency but it is commonly pre-installed in (or packaged for) mainstream distros.

However, if and when their arises the moment someone lacks xclip or a means to obtain it, then I'll probs remove it as a dependency
